# Java client/server side NTLMv2 authentication example.

This is a sample implentation of the NTLMv2 authentication protocol for the client and server side. For the authentication the [ntlmv2-auth](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ntlmv2auth) library is used and a minimal jetty server and client is provided.

This example is just for showing the workflow of the NTLMv2 authentication. Therefore things like error handling, content validation or synchronisation of variables are ignored.
